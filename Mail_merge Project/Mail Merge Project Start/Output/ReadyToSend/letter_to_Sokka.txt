Dear Sokka,

A veritable smorgasbord of social delights and scandal. The ton has barely recovered from the explosive events of last year, when a new diamond enters the scene.

The enigmatic Anthony Bridgerton, newly appointed Viscount, vows to find a suitable wife. But will duty or desire guide his hand? He sets his sights on the charming Edwina Sharma, fresh from India.

And what of our favorite gossip columnist? Fear not, dear reader. Lady Whistledown remains ever vigilant, her quill poised to capture the season's juiciest secrets.

Until next time, stay curious, and never underestimate the power of a well-placed rumor.
